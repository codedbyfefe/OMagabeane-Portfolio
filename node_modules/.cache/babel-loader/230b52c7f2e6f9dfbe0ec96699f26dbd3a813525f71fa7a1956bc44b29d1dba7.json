I began with the goal of creating an engaging and functional user interface to improve user experience, while also aiming to enhance my programming skills and develop a solid concept. These goals guided my individual work and later informed our group project. Initially, I planned to work solo, but I joined a group with shared interests in app development. Our concept emerged from our university experiences during the pandemic, leading us to design a student-focused app that addressed both academic and social aspects of student life. Early critiques helped us refine our idea, identify essential features, and conduct surveys to guide development. Despite early struggles with backend development and overambitious planning, we adjusted our scope and focused on producing a working demo. Constructive feedback led us to simplify the app’s features, focusing on campus events, local hotspots, and a campus map, with added functionality like food ordering to improve student convenience. Our third critique showed real progress, and though we faced technical issues and time constraints, we pulled together as a group to deliver a functional prototype. Working in a group was challenging—coordination, uneven task distribution, and miscommunication impacted our workflow—but we eventually adapted and found ways to collaborate effectively. Individually, I grew more confident in my programming abilities and deepened my understanding of UI/UX through hands-on research and testing. While I didn’t fully meet all my initial goals, I gained valuable skills and experience, especially in facing real-world project challenges and learning to adapt. In the end, our app concept remains strong despite minor technical issues. Screen recordings helped demonstrate intended functionality, and our final presentation showed just how much progress we made. I’m proud of what we achieved and optimistic about the project’s potential for future development.\"\n}, {\n  slug: \"resource-management-game\",\n  title: \"Resource Management Game\",\n  description: \"Game Design & Development — 7.5.22\",\n  image: \"/images/RM1.png\",\n  role: \"Game Designer & Developer — led game concept creation, mechanic design, art direction, UI implementation, and integration of accessibility features.\",\n  tools: \"C#, Unity\",\n  overview: \"This game prototype is a 2D resource management simulation game with a unique barter-based economy, where players grow crops, manage livestock, and trade resources without traditional currency.

By consolidating these features, UNI reduces the cognitive load of managing campus life, promotes community engagement, and ensures students have reliable, relevant, and easily accessible information at their fingertips. The design prioritizes simplicity, accessibility, and a clear visual hierarchy, ensuring students can find what they need with minimal effort.\",\n    problem: \"University students, especially those new to campus or new to a different city, often struggle with fragmented and inconsistent sources of information. Navigating to lecture halls, staying updated on campus events, and finding safe, affordable nearby services often requires juggling multiple unconnected apps, bulletin boards, and word-of-mouth recommendations. This scattered approach wastes time, increases stress, and leads to missed opportunities for social engagement or resource access. Furthermore, many existing tools are generic — like Google Maps or public event listings — and don’t account for the unique needs of students, such as safety considerations, cost-effectiveness, or campus-specific facilities. Without a centralized, student-focused platform, the overall university experience remains less connected, less efficient, and less engaging.\",\n    process: \"Conducted surveys to understand student needs and preferences Designed detailed wireframes and wireflows for navigation, events, and ordering features.

Feedback from initial demonstrations indicated strong interest, with students expressing that the integration of campus navigation, events, and food ordering could save them time and make their daily routines smoother. Even with some features trimmed due to technical constraints, the core functionality was well-received, showing that UNI’s value lies in its ability to connect multiple aspects of campus life in one seamless experience. This positive reception validated the concept and provided a clear roadmap for future development, including adding academic integrations and expanding coverage beyond the Wits campus.\",\n    pdfLink: \"/projects/UNIIConcept.pdf\",         // <-- PDF file ( concept document)\n    pdfLink: \"/projects/UNIIPITCHDECK.pdf\",         // <-- PDF file (Pitch Deck document)\n    reflection:\"My overall experience with this project was both challenging and rewarding. I began with the goal of creating an engaging and functional user interface to improve user experience, while also aiming to enhance my programming skills and develop a solid concept. These goals guided my individual work and later informed our group project. Initially, I planned to work solo, but I joined a group with shared interests in app development. Our concept emerged from our university experiences during the pandemic, leading us to design a student-focused app that addressed both academic and social aspects of student life. Early critiques helped us refine our idea, identify essential features, and conduct surveys to guide development. Despite early struggles with backend development and overambitious planning, we adjusted our scope and focused on producing a working demo. Constructive feedback led us to simplify the app’s features, focusing on campus events, local hotspots, and a campus map, with added functionality like food ordering to improve student convenience. Our third critique showed real progress, and though we faced technical issues and time constraints, we pulled together as a group to deliver a functional prototype. Working in a group was challenging—coordination, uneven task distribution, and miscommunication impacted our workflow—but we eventually adapted and found ways to collaborate effectively. Individually, I grew more confident in my programming abilities and deepened my understanding of UI/UX through hands-on research and testing. While I didn’t fully meet all my initial goals, I gained valuable skills and experience, especially in facing real-world project challenges and learning to adapt. In the end, our app concept remains strong despite minor technical issues. Screen recordings helped demonstrate intended functionality, and our final presentation showed just how much progress we made. I’m proud of what we achieved and optimistic about the project’s potential for future development.\"\n\n  },\n  {\n    slug: \"resource-management-game\",\n    title: \"Resource Management Game\",\n    description: \"Game Design & Development — 7.5.22\",\n    image: \"/images/RM1.png\",\n    role: \"Game Designer & Developer — led game concept creation, mechanic design, art direction, UI implementation, and integration of accessibility features.\",\n    tools: \"C#, Unity\",\n    overview:\"This game prototype is a 2D resource management simulation game with a unique barter-based economy, where players grow crops, manage livestock, and trade resources without traditional currency.
